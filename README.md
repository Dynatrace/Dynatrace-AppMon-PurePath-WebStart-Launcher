## Tool Information

This launcher consists of a website that allows you to enter a PurePath ID, launches the dynaTrace client and opens the specified PurePath.

## Installation

  1. Download [PPDrill Dashboard](PPDrill.dashboard.xml) and import it into your dynaTrace server. 

  2. Download the [PurePath WebStart Launcher ZIP File](PP_WebStart_Launcher.zip) and unzip it to a location of your choice. 

  3. Open PP_WebStart_Launch.html 

  4. To use the PurePath Launcher, you need to specify your dynaTrace server name or IP, as well as a Dashboard that will be opened on startup. The dashboard can also be empty, and we suggest to create an empty "PPDrill" dashboard. 

  5. Just paste your PurePath ID into the appropriate field and click the "details" button. This will start the WebStart client and display the "Search for a PurePath" dialog, already pre-filled with the specified PurePath ID. Click OK to search for the PurePath.
